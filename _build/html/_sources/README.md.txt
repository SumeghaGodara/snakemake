Reproducible Workflows using Snakemake and Singularity
===
![logo](/img/logos/rep_research_logo.png)

> **The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses and can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition.**

> **Singularity is an open source-based container platform designed for scientific and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Singularity supports Bring Your Own Environment (BYOE)—where entire Singularity environments can be transported between computational resources (e.g., users’ PCs) with reproducibility.**

+ Basic [**UNIX command-line**](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) experience required. [Bootcamp](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=6oprpl4mlf4)
+ You don't need to be an expert at Python to use Snakemake, but it can sometimes be very useful.
